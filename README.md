# MastersThesisResources
All programs, flows and files created in the context of my master's thesis.

Here are 4 folders with exports for different programs that I have tested, including benchmark programs.

In Resources folder, you can find my SQLite database and possible some other useful files.

In otherLanguageHelpers folder there are all tools that are useful or not that I have used in languages: java, node.js
and Go. Project structure might not be very good, since I haven't put much attention to legacy code in here. 

### Other projects
This repository doesn't contain my custom nodes, since they are seperate GitHub repos.

* [My set-defaults node](https://github.com/domenn/node-red-contrib-set-defaults)
* [My modified interval node](https://github.com/domenn/node-red-contrib-interval)

TODO:
* Link to PDF once it gets published

### More information
If you have any problem or question, feel free to contact me and I will be glad to help. Not all files in this 
repo are greatly organized. And not all instructions are written. So if you don't find the information that you need,
just contact me and I will add missing info.

You can use github issue request or contact me over email.
