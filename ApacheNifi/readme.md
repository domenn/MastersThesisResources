Nifi exports can be used as templates. To use my files, use "Operate" panel on the left,
click on "Upload Template" button. Later you drag "Template" component from the toolbar
on top, then select the correct template.

* NifiFinalStateWithBenchmark.xml: all flows in my final state of NiFi workspace. Includes
MQTT benchmark.
* BackupNifi1.xml: Intermediate state that I had one time, not sure what it is.
* NifiFlowFinal2.xml: simple MQTT and putFile testing / examples.
