Files that need to be used for Flow for my items to work.

* filereader.js: this is modified original filereader that does not overwrite message properties.
[Link to original](https://github.com/totaljs/flowcomponents/tree/master/filereader)
* performancemeter.js: self explainatory
* sqlite.js: requires sqlite3 npm module installed. Code is modeled after
[node-red sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-red-node-sqlite)

Copy (or symlink) the files to <your_flow_installation>/flow.
