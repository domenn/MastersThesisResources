### Node-RED flows

Hopefully file names are self explainatory. Otherwise, import it and read comments.

##### Requirements
In no particular order. Not every requirement is needed for all. If it is not installed, Node-RED will warn you after
import and then you can add requirements. I list versions that I use, but newer versions will probably work.
